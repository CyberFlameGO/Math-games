A couple of HTML5 puzzles

These two puzzles are intended to be for exploration in math education. 
The block game puzzle is for early childhood education, and the graph game
puzzle is for students who are learning to graph distance vs time situations.

Both games need some polishing to have sufficient depth as they are both
proofs of concepts.

Please feel free to download and modify these projects as you see fit,
but please let me know what changes you make.

Thanks,

David Wees
